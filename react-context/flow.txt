USER CAN SIGN In
within the auth page component we want to check the path of the url
if the path is equal to sign in then the text 'Pleae sign in to continue' would be displayed
if the path is not sign in then the text will display Create an account to get started
after we check these conditions then we return the user message with the classes and styles applied to the applied
the handleSign in method is called and gets the token from localStorage and sets it equal to the user so that the server can verify that the user is verfied
