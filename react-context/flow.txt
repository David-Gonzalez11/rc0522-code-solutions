USER CAN SIGN UP
within the auth page component we want to check the path of the url so that it can show the sign Up page
if the path is equal to sign in then the text 'Pleae sign in to continue' would be displayed and you would be able to enter  a password and username
when the user enters a username and a password is it sent to the server and the server checks all conditions
the passowrd is then hashed which is sent to the database
the username and password are then store into a database




USER CAN SIGN IN
Once the user has signed up then the data (username and password) are stored in the database
if the path is equal to sign up or Sign in the the <Auth />  componentwill be called
this component will chech the rout path and if it is equal to signIn then the sign In page is displayed with the elcome message of Please sign in to continue
once the correct message is display then the user can enter their sign in information
this will fetch the data from the database and will check if the user data is valid
if the data is valid by checking the usersToken then the user will be signed in
we will then setState to the user




USER CAN STAY SIGNED In
when the user is logged in the token is verified so the user can stay logged in even the page is refeshed
state is updated when the user refreshes so that the users token is always tied to that user


USER CAN SIGN OUT

when the user is logged in with the correct token then the user will see a sign out button
when the sign out button is clicked then the handleSignout method gets called
when this method gets called then the toekn is removed from localStorge and the users State is set to null
when it is set to null then state gets updated to isAuthoriing false which means that the user is not signing in or creating an account so it displays the main page
